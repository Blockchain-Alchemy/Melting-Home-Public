# Melting Home

## Summary

Melting Home is a WebGL Blockchain game on the Solana Blockchain. It combines Extreme Snowboarding and Climate Impact. Before each ride - the player is able to donate Solana tokens (SOL) to climate change charities of their choice. 

## Blockchain Mechanics

### Token Donation
The game sends an optional batch transaction to give the player the ability to donate to leading charities in climate change affected animal welfare.

### Wallet Based Leaderboard
At the end of the ride, the player can choose to be added to the leaderboard. Their score is multiplied by their donation and wadded with their public wallet address - to give the most accureate ranking of impact.

## Roadmap

We are dedicated to saving animals that will be affected by climate change. We all do our part. We make games for you to enjoy. Here is what we're planning:
