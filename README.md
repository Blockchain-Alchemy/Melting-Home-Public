## Summary

Melting Home is a WebGL Blockchain game on the Solana Blockchain. It combines Extreme Snowboarding and Climate Impact. Before each ride - the player is able to donate Solana tokens (SOL) to climate change charities of their choice. 

## Playable Demo

## Impact
Melting Home works on the concept of reciprocity. It's a free game that's very fun and compelling. It encourages players to contribute to charities that fight climate change, through a leaderboard that multiplies your score by your donation. 


## Culture and Business Model
The Melting Home culture centers around extreme sports, cute animals and allows our members to trade custom snowboards as NFTs and compete for exlusive prizes. By combining social impact, snowboard games and NFTs - we provide a unique niche in culture and gaming.

## Blockchain Mechanics

### Token Donation
The game sends an optional batch transaction to give the player the ability to donate to leading charities in climate change affected animal welfare.

### Wallet Based Leaderboard
At the end of the ride, the player can choose to be added to the leaderboard. Their score is multiplied by their donation and wadded with their public wallet address - to give the most accureate ranking of impact.

## Roadmap
